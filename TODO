	IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER:

+ Completely refactor everything; this thing is basically a tech demo I made to
test clicking on a hexagonal grid that slowly accumulated more and more
features... like tumors. It's all horribly inefficient and poorly-hacked-
together solutions to basic problems, with some bugfixes stuck on top like duct
tape. Everything needs to be rewritten more-or-less from scratch to have a
proper framework.

+ Once that's done, multiplayer would be a lot easier to implement.

+ Rewrite localization handling. I have a later, also-incomplete project with a
much better handling of localization strings (including changing language at
run-time rather than needing to edit an INI file), which also handles loading
text from "mod" folders (which should be adaptable to SpaceWar's themes easily
enough). The only reason this tattered monstrosity of a localization system got
into the game in the first place is because it was the first solution I wrote
that worked... and as the change log for v0.7.2 indicates, it only "worked" on
filesystems that didn't care that it was re-reading the file every time it
wanted to do... well, ANYTHING.

+ Decoupling graphics from game logic entirely would be nice, to allow for ships
bigger than 9x9 pixels. This may or may not be doable before the massive
refactoring effort.
    + Of course, if it's not done before the massive refactoring, the massive
      refactoring will include this and more as a matter of course.
